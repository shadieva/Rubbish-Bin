# Rubbish-Bin
Rubbish bin for final Engineering Graphics
Why we did choose the rubbish bin? In our city it’s very dirty everyone throws trash anywhere where they want, so we were inspired by this and decided to make a smart rubbish bin. This is the story of how did we come to this idea.
 First of all, we made an object of our rubbish bin in OpenSCAD then we will print out our bin in 3Dprinter. After that we going to join electronic device with controller to our bin and connect completely with the its cover.

How does this mechanism work? In appearance the mechanism seems very complicated but in fact it is very simple. So when someone comes close to our Rubbish bin it automatically opens and you don’t need to open it by yourself so it is more comfortable. Such little things make our life easier and more comfortable.
